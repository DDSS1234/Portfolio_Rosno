    <p>Every material and process is an act of choice. I design to unlock meaning and beauty from what is at hand by crafting experiences that are thoughtful, creative and economically sound. Informed by my life as a collegiate athlete, amateur bodybuilder, and lifelong student in both psychology and philosophy, I anchor every design in the human experience - resilient, purposeful and centered on people.</p>
