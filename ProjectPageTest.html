    <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
    <p> The lessons and land come first. In the Northeast stands a strong library, open to both student and citizen. Good soil is at the heart of the farm and it is worked with new tools that help feed the town two times over. The farm teaches as it feeds. Students learn with their hands and eyes. Anything harvested goes to the students and then to the people. Then comes the desire to know. They learn from the farms. The town is awake and healthy.</p>
